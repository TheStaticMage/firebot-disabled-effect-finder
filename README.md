# Firebot Disabled Effect Finder

## Introduction

This [Firebot](https://firebot.app) plugin finds disabled effects in your setup so you can confirm what should stay off before you go live. It provides Firebot variables that list disabled effects across events, preset effect lists, and other features, making it easy to double-check your choices.

## Features

- Lists disabled effects across channel rewards, custom commands, events, preset effect lists, scheduled tasks, and timers
- Exposes variables you can drop into your own preset effect lists or messages
- Includes a starter Firebot Setup that surfaces disabled effects in your Firebot chat feed so you can review them quickly

## Usage

The easiest way to get started is to import the "Disabled Effect Finder" preset effect list:

1. Download [`disabled-effect-finder.firebotsetup`](/disabled-effect-finder.firebotsetup) and save it somewhere easy to find.
2. In Firebot, go to File &gt; Firebot Setups &gt; Import Firebot Setup. Select the setup file you just downloaded and follow the prompts.

You can now run the preset effect list by clicking the play button in the Preset Effect List screen.
